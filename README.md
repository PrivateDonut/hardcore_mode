     - XP bonuses
     - Safe levels
     - Resurrection tokens

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I convert my existing character to hardcore?**
A: No, only new level 1 characters can enable hardcore mode.

**Q: What happens when I die?**
A: Your character becomes permanently dead. You cannot resurrect unless you have resurrection tokens.

**Q: Can I disable hardcore mode?**
A: No, once enabled it cannot be disabled. Choose carefully!

**Q: Can hardcore players group together?**
A: Yes in standard mode, but not in Ironman mode.

**Q: Do I keep my rewards if I die?**
A: Your character remains dead, but any achievements or rewards already earned are kept.

**Q: How do milestone rewards work for hardcore/ironman players?**
